## 0.2.0

- Added `clone`.
- Added `infinity` sets, which behave somewhat as if they contain every possible value (where possible)
- Added `comparisonScan`, which reports differences and similarities in order in callbacks. Really you could define all of the other methods in terms of this, but it seems to be very slightly slower.

## 0.1.0

- Initial version.
